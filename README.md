# postgres-rum

This is the [official PostgreSQL image](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres), with [RUM](https://github.com/postgrespro/rum) added on. Perhaps you'd like to use this with [Pleroma](https://pleroma.social/)? Build it yourself, or get it from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/jordemort/postgres-rum).

## :warning: This thing is kind of a mess :warning:

It needs updating beyond Postgres 12 and the upstream package repositories are weird and inconsistent about dev pacakges and I really haven't had time to sort it all out yet.
